Abstract--Farming is key to keep up a nation's money flow because 
it makes food crops. So, plant sicknesses are big risks to farm plants, 
leading to large money loss and less food all over the world. Old 
ways of finding these diseases, which mainly rely on touch, take a 
lot of time and often have errors. This work shows a full way to 
make new crop sickness finding tools. These use new tech like image 
checks, learning from data, and scanning from afar together. CNNs, 
a type of tech, can look at pictures of sick plants and spot and sort 
out usual plant diseases very well. Knowing crop sicknesses is key 
to keeping a farm community alive. Spotting these illnesses right 
and fast is vital for the field's health and output, and stops loss of 
cash and more. Every day, crop sicknesses cost farmers big money 
all over the world. Learning well helps farmers find diseases early 
in the crop leaves, so stopping crop loss. The model gets smart on a 
mix of good and bad plant pics, telling sickness types apart, like 
harm, rust, and mold. The system then warns farmers, via an app 
or web page, when it spots a disease and gives tips on how to treat 
it. Spotting issues early helps farmers make better choices. It cuts 
down the use of bad chemicals and improves the well-being and 
growth of crops. This work taps into AI's ability to scale up and save 
costs.
